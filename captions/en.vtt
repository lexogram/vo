00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello!

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.270
I am going to record your story
“Conversation” on video.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.679
First I will read it slowly

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.490
and then at a natural speed.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.830
What job do you do?

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.080
I’m a genetic engineer.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.310
You create seeds for genetically modified food?

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.490
No, I develop seeds for the clothing industry.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.430
My team has extracted the DNA from teeshirts,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.700
and we have inserted specific genes
into the DNA of cotton

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.080
and now teeshirts grow directly on the cotton plants.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.550
Неужели?

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.000
Soon, you will be able
to grow your own teeshirts at home.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.400
They just grow on their own

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.150
until they reach the desired size,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.100
and then you can pick them.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.060
Are the teeshirts just a plain colour?

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.950
Or can they have custom designs?

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.420
At the moment, just one (colour),

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.300
but you can choose the colour

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.800
by adding one pigment or another to the water

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.430
which you use to water the cotton plant.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.630
And what about you?

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.620
What’s your job?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.800
I’m a snail farmer.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.990
Cool!

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.300
It seems to me

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.600
I did not really manage to record that slowly,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.700
but now I will read it like

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.399
I would read it for myself.

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:52.950
What job do you do?

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.600
I’m a genetic engineer.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.729
You create seeds for genetically modified food?

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.609
No, I develop seeds for the clothing industry.

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.590
My team has extracted the DNA from teeshirts,

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.030
and we have inserted specific genes
into the DNA of cotton

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.060
and now teeshirts grow directly on the cotton plants.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.310
Really?

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.800
Soon, you will be able
to grow your own teeshirts at home.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.800
They just grow on their own

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.310
until they reach the desired size,

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.940
and then you can pick them.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.550
Are the teeshirts just a plain colour?

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.580
Or can they have custom designs?

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.600
At the moment, just one (colour),

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.100
but you can choose the colour

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.300
by adding one pigment or another to the water

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.830
which you use to water the cotton plant

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.560
And what about you?

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.790
What’s your job?

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.240
I’m a snail farmer.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.470
Cool!
