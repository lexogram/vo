# VO
#### A web site for learning a foreign language using subtitled and annotated videos

The VO site is designed for language learners. It mimics and extends the concept pioneered by the [TEDÂ talks](ted.com), adding tools to help assimilate the new ideas and language that the visitor discovers. 

Each page consists of a short video story or presentation. The video can display subtitles in a number of languages, and is accompanied by an interactive transcript, and a language Resource Area.

- Clicking on the transcript jumps to the appropriate place in the video.
- Words, expressions and sentences can be played repeatedly with an adjustable pause between repetitions.
- Selecting text in the transcript displays it in the Resource Area, so that you can consult online sites like Wiktionary inline, and create and share your own notes on what expressions mean and how they are connected.

Registration is optional. Registered users can connect to their profile from multiple devices, and share a device with other registered users. The profile data of unregistered users may be deleted after an extended period of inactivity.

As the site develops, we plan to develop algorithms which will track the progress of your learning and suggest new videos for you to watch that are adapted to your interests and your mastery of your new language.
