# VO
#### A web site for learning a foreign language using subtitled and annotated videos

The VO site is designed for language learners. It mimics and extends the concept pioneered by the [TED talks](ted.com), adding tools to help assimilate the new ideas and language that the visitor discovers. 

Each page consists of a short video story or presentation. The videos show a close-up of the speaker's face, with images to illustrate the meaning. Each video can display subtitles in a number of languages, and is accompanied by an interactive transcript, plus a customizable Language Resource Area.

- Clicking on the transcript jumps to the appropriate place in the video.
- Words, expressions and sentences can be played repeatedly with an adjustable pause between repetitions.
- Selecting text in the transcript displays it in the Resource Area, so that you can consult online sites like Wiktionary inline, and create and share your own notes on what expressions mean and how they are connected.

Your progress is shadowed in a database, so that it can refresh your memory about the words that you know you have already seen, but which you haven't quite assimilated yet. As the site develops, we plan to develop algorithms which will track the progress of your learning and suggest new videos for you to watch that are adapted to your interests and your mastery of your new language.

Registration is optional. Registered users can connect to their profile from multiple devices, and share a device with other registered users. The profile data of unregistered users may be deleted after an extended period of inactivity.

The companion [Graded Writing](https://github.com/lexogram/graded-writing) project provides a workflow for creating new videos to present in VO. You are more than welcome to suggest new topics and to add your own contributions to the site.

(VO stands for *Version Originale* — in French, this is used to describe foreign language films in the original language, complete with subtitles.)
